With open sourced code found here on github. I plan on Creating a pancakeSwap like DEX. With a DEX under my subdomain and branded accordingly to my liking and easier for users with no crypto knowledghe can manage, I want to create a token

We will call that token XTOKEN for now. I want to add it into our liquidity pool. Our token can only be found on our liquidity pool for now. When users buy our token they can use those tokens on eCommercer sites we setup straight from their crypto wallets.

Why would people want to use our token? even our exchange?
Our token will come with a few added benefits, this token will also serve as our voting token, any user with any amount of the coin will be able to vote in what we do with our business. 
We will listen to any concerns our audience has.

Along with purchasing the token we want the token to serve as a currency rather than a stock, so when users own this token and they navigate to any our our Ecommerce sites we merge with or create, discounts will apply just for using our token. 

We hope through time people using our token as actual money rather than an investment we will be able to stabilize our coins and have a working system where money flows, rather than sitting in unused crypto wallets.
